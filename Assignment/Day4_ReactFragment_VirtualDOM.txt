5. Why we need keys in React ? When we need keys in React?
Ans.
When we have multiple children with same attribute or same tag / type then react won't be able to determine which is updated or lets take an example  :
 3 <div > are there and we have added one more div on top react won't be able to identify in which position new element is added , to identify this we need to add keys. If we don't add key react will rerender all 4 divs and if add key only newly added element will be rendered.
 
 It is a good practice to add keys , but if we have multiline children of same type then key must be used.
