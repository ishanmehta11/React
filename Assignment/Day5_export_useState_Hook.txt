hooks: 
1. What is diff b/w Named export , Default export and * as export?
Ans.
Deafult Export : By default it we can export one object.
syntax (export):  export default Header.
syntax (Import) : import Header from "./header"

Named Export : when we want to export extra objects than deafult export , then named export is used.
with object creation will use export keyword as below : 
syntax(export) : 
export const Title = () =>{
    return (
   <h1>named export</h1>
    );
    };
	
syntax(import) : 
import {Title} from "./header"

* as export : 
in this case we can combine muliple exports in single name and use with .
eg 
import * as obj from "./header"
Title can be used like this
{obj.Title}

Note : In Deafult case while importing we can give any name to object , but in named export same name should be used while importing.

we can use default and named import together like this : 
import Header , {Title} from "./Header"
considering Header id deafult export and Tilte is named export in Header.js file

2. What is use of config.js?
ans. 

3. What is a Hook?
ans. Hook is a normal JS function 

4. Why do we need useState Hook?
ans.  useState is used to create state variables.
useState comes from react library and we use it by named import.
useState() , returns an array first element is the variable name , and second is the function by w

eg. 
const [searchText , setSearchText] = useState("");

searchText is a local state variable.

React will track only state variable.
if we create a normal js variable and value is changed, react won't know that it has be rendered bcoz react don't track normal JS variables.
React only tracks state variables and State variables are created by useState().When state variable value is changed then react will know about it and automatic rerender will happen.

When a statevariable is changed then the whole component will be rerendered bcoz its state is updated 
and the reason why whole component is rerendering is that state variable could be used muliple times inside the component
